## RESEARCH ACTIVITIES & INTERESTS
My doctoral dissertation investigated the method of designing efficient single-photon sources for quantum information applications. I was employed as a Postdoctoral Researcher and then a Research Fellow in Prof. John Rarity‘s group. My work as a Research Fellow (Researcher Co-Investigator and Co-Investigator) under the EPSRC Research Grants ([EP/M009033/1](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/M009033/1) and [EP/P034446/1](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/P034446/1)) has led research in direct laser writing using two-photon polymerisation in the Quantum Engineering Technology Labs, and I am also an Assistant Professor at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering in Bristol.<br> 
In September 2019, I started a position as a Vice-Chancellor’s Senior Fellow in Physics and Electrical Engineering, after a career in Quantum Photonics research at the University of Bristol. Currently, I am the head of the  Nanophotonic Engineering Laboratory (NEL) and leads an EPSRC Research Grant [(EP/V040030/1)](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/V040030/1) to develop and conduct Nanophotonics research, which focuses on a comprehensive investigation into the fundamentals and applications of 3D nanophotonics in artificially structured materials. The project is in collaboration with research partners (QET Labs, University of Bristol and ORC, University of Southampton) and industrial partner (Oxford Instruments Plasma Technology) to develop novel sensors, biomimetic structures, nano-lasers, and ultrafast optical switches and devices for quantum technology.<br>
Additionally, my recently awarded Royal Society Research Grant, providing funding to purchase an advanced microscope heating stage. The unique combination of a commercial heating stage for pressure, vacuum, and temperature control and an in-house built Fourier image spectroscopy (FIS) for a broadband and wide angle-resolved scattering characterization in the visible and infrared range as a thermal analysis technique in thermophotovoltaic research.<br>
