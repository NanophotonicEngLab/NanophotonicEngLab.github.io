## RESEARCH ACTIVITIES & INTERESTS
My research interests centre on nanofabrication, modelling, and characterisation of novel 3D periodic material-based micro-/nanostructures to enable applications in nanophotonics, optoelectronics, energy storage, medical applications, and quantum technologies. My research group ([Nanophotonic Engineering Laboratory](https://nanophotonicenglab.github.io/)) focuses on the realization of high-resolution artificially structured materials for efficient control of light-matter interactions, developing opto-electrical characteristics, direct wide angle-resolved scattering reflectance measurements using Fourier imaging spectroscopy (FIS), and on the fabrication of devices and materials based on a diverse range of nanofabrication approaches (FIB, DLW-2PP, ELB, CVD, and ALD, etc.)

My current funding (~£0.5M) supports including 3D Nanophotonics in Artificially Structured Chalcogenide Materials (EPSRC New Investigator Award - [(EP/V040030/1)](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/V040030/1)), which focuses on a comprehensive investigation into the fundamentals and applications of 3D nanophotonics in artificially structured materials in collaboration with research partners (QET Labs, University of Bristol and ORC, University of Southampton) and industrial partner (Oxford Instruments Plasma Technology) to develop novel sensors, biomimetic structures, nano-lasers, and ultrafast optical switches and devices for quantum technology and Exploring Topology-Optimised Metasurface Architectures for Solar-thermal Absorption (Royal Society Research Grants - RGS\R1\221031), which is an unique combination of a commercial heating stage for pressure, vacuum, and temperature control and an in-house built Fourier image spectroscopy (FIS) for a broadband and wide angle-resolved scattering characterization in the visible and infrared range as a thermal analysis technique in thermophotovoltaic research.

Prior to this appointment, I received my BSc degree in Electrical Engineering from the National Taipei University of Technology in Taiwan and gained his PhD in Quantum Photonics in 2007 undertaking my doctoral research at the University of Bristol, UK. I then joined the group of Prof. John Rarity in the Quantum Engineering Technology Labs as a Postdoctoral Researcher and then a Research Fellow where he worked on the EPSRC Research projects ([EP/M009033/1](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/M009033/1) and [EP/P034446/1](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/P034446/1)) and led research in 3D direct laser writing system using two-photon polymerisation, and I am also a Visiting Academic at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Bristol.
