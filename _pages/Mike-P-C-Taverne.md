## RESEARCH ACTIVITIES & INTERESTS
•	Research interests: My research interests lie primarily in the field of Quantum Optics, Nanophotonics, Nanomanufacturing techniques and computational photonics. I am an expert in nanofabrication (3D additive nanomanufacturing and focused ion beam etching), modelling (Finite-Difference Time-Domain, and plane-wave expansion methods) and characterisation (in-house built Fourier imaging spectroscopy). My area right now has focused on the artificially structured electromagnetic materials for efficient control of light-matter interactions and the development of advanced optoelectronic devices for practical applications (e.g., sensing, light trapping, and solar energy harvesting, and quantum technology, etc.).
