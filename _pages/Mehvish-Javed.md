## EDUCATION

* Master in Microelectronics and Communication Engineering from Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom
* Master of Philosophy (Physics, Materials Science) from the Institute of Physics, Islamia University Bahawalpur, Pakistan in 2020
* Master of Science in Physics from Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, Pakistan in 2014

## RESEARCH EXPERIENCES

* “Synthesis of UiO-66 MOF Piezo-Composite and Development of an Ultrasonic Range System for a Wearable Self-Charging Nonocclusive Pulse and Blood Pressure Monitoring System” (Present)                                                                                            
  
  Nanoparticles of UiO-66 Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) were synthesized by combining Zirconium tetrachloride and terephthalic acid. The resulting nanoparticles were incorporated into Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) at a concentration of 5 weight percent to enhance the β-crystalline phase. The PVDF nanofiber mat containing MOF particles (referred to as PVDF-5 wt % MOF) was combined with Cu-sputtered aluminum foil to produce a piezoelectric sensor. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were employed to examine the α and β phases of the sensor, respectively, and to assess the piezoelectric constant by analyzing the slope of voltage variation with displacement. A voltage measurement system was developed using an ESP32 microcontroller to measure the voltage generated by the pulse. Additionally, an ultrasound range system was created using a PIC16F1769 microcontroller to measure vein diameter from reflected ultrasound waves. Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) was measured using two piezoelectric sensors. The values of vein diameter and PWV were utilized to calculate blood pressure. A wearable device was designed that included two printed circuit boards (PCBs), a piezoelectric sensor, and Peltier modules. Pulse and blood pressure readings were displayed on an OLED screen and the Blynk IoT platform.
* “Ab-initio study on structural, electronic, magnetic and optical behavior of AGA2O4 (A = Ge, Co) spinel oxides” (2020)        
 
  This study investigates the substitutional effect of 𝐶𝑜 ions at the tetrahedral (site A) cation sites of non-magnetic 𝐺𝑒𝐺𝑎2𝑂4 spinel oxide. The Wien2k Code, which is based on density functional theory, was employed to compute spin-polarized structural, electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of 𝐺𝑎2𝑂4 spinel oxides doped with both 𝐶𝑜 and 𝐺𝑒 ions, utilizing the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The computational results revealed significant differences in the properties of 𝐶𝑜-doped 𝐺𝑒𝐺𝑎2𝑂4, including lattice constant, optical band gap, electronic band gap, the total magnetic moment per unit cell, and saturation magnetization. The study provides a detailed examination of these properties in the presence of 𝐶𝑜 substitution in the host composition of 𝐺𝑒𝐺𝑎2𝑂4 spinel oxide. Additionally, the potential applications of the doped spinel systems as magneto-semiconductors are outlined.
